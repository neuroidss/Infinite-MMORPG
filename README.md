```
make strategic plan and then build mmorpg game with pvp, infinite levelup, infinite pve mob grind for artifacts, every minute free wishes for artifacts gacha where onserver ollama qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q8_0 chatbot with tools generates new artifacts and mobs, threejs, nipplejs. make keyboard wasd for 3d move & mouse movement for 3d look, real gamepad and multitouch onscreen gamepad joysticks controls left for 3d move and right for 3d move, should be desktop and mobile ready. make sure not using browser alert() popups. frontend in single html&css&js block, backend in another single block, required setup and run in another single sh block. fully implement all features.
here elemental resonance pyro with hydro vaporize, with electro over-load, with cryo melt, with dendro burning, with anemo swirl, with geo crystalyze, hydro with electro electro-charged, with cryo frozen, with dendro bloom with pyro burgeon with electro hyper-bloom, with anemo swirl, with geo crystalyze, electro with cryo super-conduct, with dendro quicken spread aggravate, cryo with wind swirl, with geo crystalyze.
create chatbot tools to generate new artifacts, mobs and dungeons.
make all fighting logic process on server to be one for all players and mobs. make 3rd person view for player. make all happen on arena with boundaries and on border of arena will appear gates to dungeon with mobs. new gates opened when chatbot finished creation of new dungeon with creatures and boss, and when boss defeated then dungeon disappears. make chatbot infinitely creates new dungeons.

make openai api calls to ollama. ollama chatbot should answer with tools use response, so make processing of tools use. all chatbot creations should be tool calls.

can equip up to 4 artifacts in battle, other collected artifacts could be switched only out of battle, can switch between main 4 but use only one at time as main attack. from defeated mobs and boss dropped artifacts, when artifact lies on ground too long it disappears. dungeon wait before close to give player collect dropped from boss artifacts before they disappear.
implement all elemental reactions.
make chatbot invent new elements and their reactions.

make code selfcommented so without  additional comments, so be easy to understand and change by local chatbot.

on bug fixes answer in diff format

import these libraries at start directly after <script type="module">:
import { io } from "https://esm.run/socket.io-client@4.7.4";
import nipplejs from "https://esm.run/nipplejs@0.10.1";
import * as THREE from "https://esm.run/three@0.160.0";

make all game logic on backend, so frontend only shows to players current game state and takes players actions.

make mobs attack nearby players, make ability to players to attack nearby players.

make chatbot sense by tool what happen in world and generating dungeons, creatures, artifacts, elements when chatbot thinks players stressed or bored, so players always feel in flow.

chatbot should use ollama via openai api via ollama, to easily switch to others like vllm. for debug purposes not run more than one chatbot api call at one time.

write to logs on backend and frontend for debug purposes, with easy ability to disable debug.

precreated content and player bots in debug mode to test that all working to not wait chatbot and other players to join. use same tools that chatbot call and same functions which used by players to not duplicate them as this is they who require debug. for player bots use logic to find and clean nearest dungeons fighting nearby players collecting artifacts. also make bots use their gacha to get artifacts.

if version on frontend is outdated then download new version from backend.

make backend version first, for easier regenerate frontend.
set custom HOSTNAME and PORT from environment.
name backend file as server, and frontend file as index.html.

make player to use gacha to get its first artifacts to defeat easiest monster.

make it possible easy to include server just inside index.html to make it single player or peer-to-peer.
